Voxels
======
Definition
    A voxel (volumetric pixel) is a volume element, representing a value on a regular grid in three dimensional space.

Benefits
    - A different look and feel
    - Relatively easy to modify
        - destruction!
        - User generated content!

Storage
    - Regular grid -> Screams array!
    - Use typed array

Rendering
    - Mesh per Voxel -> ouch. requires lots of draw() calls, uniform setting etc.
        - mention 1000 call 'limit'
        End result is typically 1500-2000 draw calls' http://developer.amd.com/gpu_assets/GDC11_DX11inBF3.pdf
    - Chunk per Mesh -> better, but still lot's of triangles
    - Only render outside -> good enough!
    -> Better triangulation is possible.

    ..Culling:

Collisions (broken voxel? render?)
    - Spheres? -> Nope door problem
    - Boxes, maybe -> stairs, corners
    - border-radius to the rescue!
    -> capsule
    But capsule vs. voxel sounds difficult!
    It's not.
    Line -> AABB distance
    Seperate axis
    Collision resolution -> use distance vector!

Rays and Picking
    - Let's look at 2D (2D slide...)
    - Bresenham Line drawing
    - 3D DDA

Capsule for physics -> border-radius
